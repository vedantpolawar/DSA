Alright — let’s break down **hashing** in a way that fits exactly with the example you just wrote.

---

## **1. What is Hashing?**

Hashing is a technique to store and retrieve data **very quickly**, usually in **O(1) time** (constant time).

Instead of **searching** through a list to find something (which takes O(n) time), hashing stores the data in such a way that you can directly jump to it in memory using a **key**.

Think of it like:

* A huge **cabinet with numbered drawers**.
* You **label** each drawer with a number (the key).
* You can **instantly go** to the correct drawer without checking all others.

---

## **2. Hashing in Your Code**

In your program:

```cpp
int hash[13] = {0};
```

* Here, `hash` is **not** about cryptography — it’s simply an **array acting as a hash table**.
* The **index** of the array is the "key".
* The **value stored** at that index is the frequency (how many times the key appeared in `arr`).

Example:

```
arr = {1, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1}
hash[1] = 2  // 1 appeared twice
hash[3] = 2  // 3 appeared twice
hash[4] = 1  // 4 appeared once
```

Here, your **key** = the number itself, and your **value** = frequency.

---

## **3. How it Works**

1. You **map** each number to an array position (key → index).
2. You **increment** the value at that position to count occurrences.
3. When someone asks “How many times does X appear?”, you **directly jump** to `hash[X]` instead of scanning the whole array.

---

## **4. Types of Hashing**

Your example is **Direct Address Hashing**:

* Works only if keys are **small integers** (like 0 to 12 in your case).
* The key is used **directly as an index**.

Other cases:

* If keys are **large numbers, strings, or complex data**, you use a **hash function** to convert them into smaller numbers (indexes).
  Example:

  ```
  index = hash_function(key)
  ```

  This is used in **unordered\_map**, **hash tables**, and cryptographic hashing.

## **5. Pros & Cons**

**✅ Advantages**

* Extremely fast lookups (O(1) on average).
* Simple to implement for small ranges.

**❌ Disadvantages**

* For large possible key ranges (e.g., 0 to 1 billion), direct arrays waste memory.
* If multiple keys map to the same index (**collision**), you need special handling.

## **6. Real-life Examples**

* Phone contact search by name → instant lookup.
* Dictionary word lookup.
* Caching systems like in browsers.
* Counting frequencies (like your code).
